          A computer is an electronic device that takes input in the form of data, process it and produce an output in a human sensible form using a program. 
        </p>
        <p>A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task.</p>
        </p>Data is raw fact or figure that has no meaning on its own. If I say give me 10. The value 10 does not make sense on its own, therefore it is a raw
          fact ie data. However, if I say give me 10 rupees. It now makes sense.</p>
          
          <p>Sample nice editors for coding are Brackets, Phoenix Code, VS Code etc.</p>
